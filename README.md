# AutoTurret

Simple Autoturret based on two MG996R positional servo motors and a D455 realsense camera. The movement is based on the image processing package which uses a tiny yolov2 from the darknet ros package.
The current setup is designed in such a way that the target is given by the human class.

## Necessary components

- Xavier Jetson Nano
- 2x MG996 servo
- 2x Axial bearings (kbs llc 51105 bearing)
- 1x Adafruit I2S 3W Class D Amplifier Breakout
